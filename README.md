# Madchine-Arm-Angle
Matlab application for finding machine arm angles and simulating motion.

The application allows you to calculate and visualize the movement of the TCP point mechanism with the structure {CR, BR1, BR2}.

The UI of the application is shown below. 
The user specifies the machine's initial coordinates, planned final position and machine parameters. He can also define the desired number of moves or deltas. 
The application outputs the resulting arm angles and visualizes in 2D the side view and top view, as well as the movement in 3D space.
